# baulchino.com - a website which purpose is to gather as many useful resources to learn mandarin

This project started in January 2025 and I try to grow it in my spare time. It has helped me learn more about how to build sites and how to handle growth on it, it is also my playground for developing and experimenting with Next.js, React, TypeScript and other services or technologies.

In Baulchino you will mainly find resources HSK orientated (but I plan to deliver more options).
