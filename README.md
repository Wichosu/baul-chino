# baulchino.com - A website with resources to learn mandarin

This project started in January 2025 and I try to grow it in my spare time. It has helped me learn more about how to build sites and how to handle growth on it, it is also my playground for developing and experimenting with Next.js, React, TypeScript and other services or technologies.

## How to run in localhost
### Requirements
- Node.js

### Installing the project
Download the main branch with git
```bash

Inside the root of the project (baulchino/) run the following commands:

```
Open your prefered browser and go to localhost:3000

DISCLAIMER: Some pages need enviroment variables to run, due to some data being fetched from my DB, I will not publish any of my env, so you can only explore some pages, if you want to make you own version of baulchino for whatever purpose feel free to contact me for more detail instruction on how to make everything work.
